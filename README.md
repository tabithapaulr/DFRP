Dashboard for Road Accident Prediction

Overview 
The Road Accident Prediction Dashboard is designed to predict the number of road accidents in 2018 based on historical data sets spanning from 2009 to 2017. The dashboard also facilitates a comparative analysis of state-wise road accident parameters and predicts states with the highest risk rates.

Features 
Prediction of road accidents for the year 2018 using linear regression and K-Means clustering algorithms.
Comparative analysis of state-wise road accident data with different parameters.
Year-wise prediction of states with the highest risk rates.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
Frontend: JSP (JavaServer Pages), Highcharts for data visualization
Backend: Servlets
Database: MySQL
Web Technologies: AJAX for asynchronous communication

Predictive Modeling:
The predictive model utilizes datasets from 2009 to 2017 taken from Open Government Data Platform India (data.gov.in) and stored in the MySQL database.
Linear regression models the relationship between predictor variables (data from 2009-2017) and the response variable (result of 2018).

Algorithms Used:
Linear Regression: Used to model the relationship between independent variables (data from 2009-2017) and the dependent variable (road accidents in 2018).
K-Means Clustering: Applied for classification and grouping of data.
